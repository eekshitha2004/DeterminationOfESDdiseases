Determination of Erythemoto â€“ Squamous Diseases using Machine Learning Classification Models

Erythemoto Squamous Diseases (ESDs) constitute a significant
category within dermatological infections, encompassing six
distinct groups namely psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, Lichen
planus, Pityriasis rosea, Chromic dermatitis and Pityriasis rubra
pilaris. These symptoms typically manifest as skin redness
(Erythema) caused based on shedding of Skin Cells
(Squamous), often attributed to genetic or environmental
factors, frequently emerging during late childhood or early
adolescence. Differential diagnosis of ESDs presents a
formidable challenge in dermatology due to overlapping initial
symptoms, subsequent disease-specific characteristics, and
shared clinical and histopathological features.
